Big button lamp currents.

Colour	3.3V	4.5V
Green	1.8mA	4.0mA
Red		3.2mA	5.7mA
Blue	1.4mA	3.8mA
White	1.3mA	3.6mA


Piezo transducer current @4.5V static = 64mA



Thoughts after first real use:
  qb|g|r|y was useless, the quiz didn't work like that.
  Scoring for bonus questions was a massive pain, especially the double marks.
    Better would be something to say "this list of teams each got the bonus question right", handling doubles automatically.
    Eg: b b? g? r? y?
  Separate into streams:
    Connectivity, including which buttons are connected, slow heartbeats, etc.
    Scoring. Definitely should be logged.
      When printing scores add (1st), (2nd), etc markers.
    Quiz control.
    Input separate to all? Only outputs command errors.
  Occasional slow heartbeats from lots of boxes. Interference? What channel am I using? Ask AP. 



Todo:
  Update this info
  Write proper docs
  Software logging
? Change to static IPs
  Make 4 more of each colour
  Make custom storage box. Flight case with cut foam?
