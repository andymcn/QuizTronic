Each buzzer unit has:
* 1 button + LED
* 1 sounder
* 2 status LEDs, 1 red and 1 green

Buzzers are hardcoded with which team they're in, reflected in the button colour.
Currently we have 4 teams, but allow for 8.

Each buzzer has a unique ID, set with links. Used to identify dodgy buttons, etc. Also specifies the team (3 msbs).

Pins required:
Button			1
Button LED		1
State LEDs		2
Sounder			1
ID (links)		7
Total			12
